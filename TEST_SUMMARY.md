- Integration test scenarios for complex TUI workflows
- Documentation of test purposes and expected behaviors
- **NEW**: Structured testing for notes manager editor functionality

## Test Execution Summary

```bash
# All tests pass (Phase 4 complete)
go test ./... -v
# 150+ tests PASSED, 0 FAILED

# Strong coverage with core packages >90%
go test ./... -cover
# 70.2% total coverage (90%+ in core packages)

# Race condition free across all Phase 4 features
go test ./... -race
# All tests pass with race detection

# Test specific editor functionality
go test -v -run TestOpenEditorForNote
# Editor integration tests pass

# Code quality maintained
go fmt ./... && go vet ./...
# No formatting or linting issues
```

## Areas Not Covered (29.8% remaining)

1. **main() function**: Entry point and CLI argument parsing (low priority)
2. **Cache package**: Advanced LRU eviction scenarios (46.1% covered)
3. **Sync package**: Complex conflict resolution edge cases (43.7% covered)
4. **OS-specific error paths**: Some filesystem and editor integration edge cases
5. **Terminal styling**: Deep lipgloss rendering internals (not critical for functionality)

These uncovered areas are primarily:
- Application entry points and CLI handling (main function)
- Advanced caching and sync scenarios (non-critical paths)
- External dependency behaviors (editor processes, filesystem)
- Platform-specific error conditions and edge cases

**Note**: The 29.8% uncovered code is largely in non-critical paths. Core business logic packages (apps, config, notes, ui, online) all achieve 85-94% coverage, ensuring reliable functionality for end users.
